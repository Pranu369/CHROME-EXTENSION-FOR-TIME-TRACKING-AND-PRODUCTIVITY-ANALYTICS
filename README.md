# CHROME-EXTENSION-FOR-TIME-TRACKING-AND-PRODUCTIVITY-ANALYTICS
This Chrome Extension, titled "Time Tracker & Productivity Analyzer", is designed to help users monitor their time usage across different websites and classify their browsing habits as productive or unproductive. The extension features a simple and user-friendly popup interface where users can manually add websites they consider productive (e.g., leetcode.com, github.com) or unproductive (e.g., youtube.com, facebook.com) through dedicated input fields and buttons like “Add Productive” and “Add Unproductive.” A “Save Settings” button allows users to store their customized website lists in the browser's local storage, ensuring their preferences persist between sessions. The extension also includes a section that displays time spent on individual websites, simulating a real-time usage summary (e.g., "youtube.com — 5 min 12 sec"), which helps users reflect on their productivity. This tool serves as an essential aid for users aiming to maintain better digital discipline, especially for students, professionals, and remote workers looking to optimize their focus and screen time.
